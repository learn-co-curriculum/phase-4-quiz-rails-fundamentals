# Routing: Route Params

Given the following route definition:

```rb
get "/dogs/:id", to: "dogs#show"
```

When a `GET` request is made to `/dogs/2,` how would you use the ID of 2 from
the URL to find the right dog?

## Correct

```rb
dog = Dog.find(params[:id])
```

> Right! The dynamic portion of the URL in the route (`:id`) becomes a key on
> the `params` hash, and we use bracket notation and pass a symbol `:id` to look
> up the value of `2`.

## Incorrect

```rb
dog = Dog.find(params[2])
```

> Not quite — this syntax isn't correct for accessing a key on a hash. Also,
> what would happen if the URL had an ID other than two?
>
> To get this method working, the dynamic portion of the URL in the route
> (`:id`) becomes a key on the `params` hash, and we use bracket notation and
> pass a symbol `:id` to look up the value of `2`.

## Incorrect

```rb
dog = Dog.find(params[id])
```

> Not quite — this syntax isn't correct for accessing a key on a hash. In this
> case, `id` would need to be a local variable or method, or this code would
> result in an error.

> To get this method working, the dynamic portion of the URL in the route

> pass a symbol `:id` to look up the value of `2`.

## Incorrect

```rb
dog = Dog.find(params.id)
```

> Not quite — this syntax isn't correct for accessing a key on a hash. Since the
> `params` hash doesn't have a method `id`, this code would result in an error.
>
> To get this method working, the dynamic portion of the URL in the route
> (`:id`) becomes a key on the `params` hash, and we use bracket notation and
> pass a symbol `:id` to look up the value of `2`.

## Incorrect
