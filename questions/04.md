# Routing: Controller Action

Given the following route definition, what controller class and method would
run?

```rb
get "/dogs", to: "dogs#index"
```

## Correct

`DogsController#index`

> Right! The `to:` option for the `get` method takes a string that Rails uses to
> determine which controller action to run for this request. The first part of
> that string is the name of the controller (`dogs`), and the second part is the
> name of the method (`index`).

## Incorrect

`DogController#index`

> Close! The `to:` option for the `get` method takes a string that Rails uses to
> determine which controller action to run for this request. The first part of
> that string is the name of the controller (`dogs`, not `dog`), and the second
> part is the name of the method (`index`).

## Incorrect

`IndexController#dogs`

> Not quite. The `to:` option for the `get` method takes a string that Rails
> uses to determine which controller action to run for this request. The
> **first** part of that string is the name of the **controller** (`dogs`, not
> `index`), and the **second** part is the name of the **method** (`index`, not
> `dogs`).

## Incorrect

I don't know.
