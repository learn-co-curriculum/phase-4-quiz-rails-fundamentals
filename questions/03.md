# Routing

When a request comes into a Rails application, which code will run first?

## Correct

Routing logic (`routes.rb`)

> Right! The routes we define in the `routes.rb` file determines which
> **controller actions** correspond to which **routes** (the combination of the
> HTTP verb and the URL path).

## Incorrect

Controller logic (`app/controllers/birds_controller.rb`)

> Not quite. Before determining which controller to use, Rails uses routes
> defined in the `routes.rb` file to see what controller action the request is
> mapped to.

## Incorrect

Model logic (`app/models/birds.rb`)

> The model comes later in the request-response cycle. First, Rails needs to
> determine which Controller has the code to run for this request by looking at
> the routes defined in the `routes.rb` file.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
