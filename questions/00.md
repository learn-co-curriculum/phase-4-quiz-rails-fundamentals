# MVC: Controller

What is the role of the Controller in a MVC application?

## Correct

To act as the go-between between the Model and the View

> Right! The controller shouldn't communicate with the database directly (that's
> the job of the Model). It also shouldn't be responsible for displaying content
> to the user (that's the role of the View).

## Incorrect

To work with the database and provide data-related logic

> This is the role of the Model, not the Controller.

## Incorrect

To display information to the user

> This is the role of the View, not the Controller.

## Incorrect

To create the different routes in our application

> This is the role of the `routes.rb` file, which is works with the controller.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
